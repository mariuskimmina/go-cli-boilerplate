# Go CLI Boilerplate

This project can be used a baseline to build your next go cli project. The code structure is based on `kubectl` by Kubernetes.

## Usage

The easiest way to use this code is to clone it and remove the git directory

```
git clone github.com/mariuskimmina/go-cli-boilerplate {yourProjectName}
cd {yourProjectName}
rm -r .git
```

You can then replace the occurences of "Demo" inside the codebase with the name of your own project.
